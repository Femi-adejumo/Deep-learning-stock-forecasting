# 📈 Deep Learning for Stock Market Forecasting

This repository contains the full implementation of my final-year project:  
**"Design and Implementation of a Deep Learning Model for MultiStock Price Forecasting and Real time Analysis."**

The project explores deep learning approaches (BiLSTM and Transformer) for predicting stock prices, with deployment via Streamlit for interactive forecasting.

## Models Implemented
- **BiLSTM (Baseline, deployed model)** – Captures sequential dependencies in stock time series.  
- **Transformer (Advanced, experimental)** – Leverages attention mechanism for long-range dependencies.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Data analysis & modeling  
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data wrangling  
- **Scikit-learn**: Preprocessing & evaluation metrics  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks  
- **yfinance, TA-Lib**: Financial data and technical indicators  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Visualization  
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web app deployment
