```

## 🧠 Models Used

- BiLSTM (Baseline)
- Transformer (TFT or PatchTST)
- Optional: DeepAR, Informer

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- yfinance, TA-Lib, matplotlib, seaborn
- Streamlit or Gradio for deployment

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit app
cd deployment
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Results

Model comparison (e.g., RMSE, MAE, Directional Accuracy) will be added here after training and evaluation.
